        Added by BENNETTONBEER - 2012
      </h3>
      Visited this pub again on 12/10/2011 in mid-afternoon to sample the offerings of this years JDW Real Ale Festival.

While it would be true to say that there was an interesting selection on that day the conditions the ale was being kept in left something to be desired, racked behind a temporary bar with little serious attempt to keep it cool and therefore the quality had already suffered.

Worse still was the chronic lack of staff and the resulting bad service. 

Twice the rather harassed and lonely member of staff serving behind the main bar was required to call for help as the Real Ale bar was left completely unattended.

This problem was noted at the last Festival, but the management of The Imperial have notably failed to address the issue.

Disappointing Wetherspoons....yet again.

        Added by BENNETTONBEER - over 8 years ago

      Visited this large Wetherspoons on Friday 27/8/2010.

As usually it had a large selection of Real Ales, and on this occasion
THATCHERS OLD RASCAL and WESTONS OLD ROSIE ciders on draught and some 12 other ciders and perrys available in a 
mini Cider Festival.

The service on this occasion was slow and disorganized, however the rather over-worked staff remained friendly and certainly attempted to be helpful.

However, it was certainly obvious that far too many of the staff were not particularly clued up on the subject of Real Ale or Cider.

Not really up to the standard that should be expected from a major organization like Wetherspoons.
