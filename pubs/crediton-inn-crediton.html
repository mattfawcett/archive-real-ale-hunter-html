    </h4>
    Visited the Crediton Inn on the 12th November 2010 for the 5th Annual Beer Festival. 

Some 27 Real Ales available over the three day festival with an interesting selection from mainly Midland and North Country Brewers.

Seven ales tried and all were in good condition, however it was more than a little off-putting to be told by the barman that he couldn&#x27;t make a recommendation as he didn&#x27;t like real ales......they had too much flavour!

There was little of the atmosphere normally associated with a Beer festival, though that might well have appeared later in the evening once a few more customers had finally arrived.
