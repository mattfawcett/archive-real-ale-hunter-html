    <h4>
      Added by BENJO - 2010


    </h4>
    We stayed here for two days,and it is without doubt the worst place i have stayed at.the bathroom was so small you had to squeeze between the bath and wash basin to reach the toilet.The tv was was was old and not tuned in, remote control missing.Beds were very low and very hard and nowhere in the room to sit down.Breakfast was at nine but at ten we were stood outside of the pub waiting for someone to open the door to let us in on both days and then start cooking breckfast for which which we had to pay extra.We were the only residents i now know why.
