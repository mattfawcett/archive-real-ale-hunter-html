Welcome to the Rose & Crown Public House, Restaurant and Caravan Site situated in Hobeach Hurn, Lincolnshire PE12 8JN.

We are proud to be listed in the 'Good Beer Guide'.

This is an Elgoods House - a family brewery based in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.

Your hosts are Janet and Kelvin Evans, ably assisted by 'The Baz' (Kelvins brother).

In the kitchen we have an unnecessarily tall person, Darren - who is our champion of home made food.

The Pub has a very warm friendly atmosphere and caters for all catagories of customers - Families, retirees, young, couples and singles and we aim to make everyone feel welcome.

In addition the Rose and Crown has it's own Camping and Caravan site - an ideal base to visit local attractions. If you want more comfort there is a bed & breakfast within one hundred yards, The Garden House.

In addition to the main lounge with traditional open fire, we have a games bar at the rear with a pool table and gaming machines.

If you like a game with your drink there's Pool, Dominoes, Darts and Cards inside, Boules (Petanque) outside and ample space in the adjoining grounds for a game of football or rounders.

There's a large patio to the rear of the pub and a beer garden as well as two landscaped ponds. In addition we have a smoking shelter with heat and light and an extensive parking space."/>

    </h4>
    The Rose &amp; Crown is the ideal village pub! Cozy log fires, great beer (hic!), and more welcoming hosts you could ever wish to meet. This pub is a must for really good real ale, wholesome (cheap) home cooked food and on the odd occasion excellent entertainment provided by the staff, free of charge! In fact this pub is so good I bought the house next door! Well done to Janet, Kelvin, &#x27;The Baz&#x27; and Darren for their effort and excellent service. *****
