<title>First and Last Inn - Exmouth | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, First and Last Inn"/>
<meta name="description" content="Locally known as the Fn'L, this is a real mixed bag of a pub. It is great for real ale, and prices couldn't be lower - Â£2 pint, (sometimes less at happy hour). I've had Otter, Teignworthy, O'Hanlon's and Branscombe beers here, all well kept and served from the cask at the bar. 

The pub is almost split into 2 areas - lower area for the older drinkers who are fixtures and fittings, and the upper area for the younger drinkers and pool players. 

This pub does have a bit of a negative reputation, and I have seen a couple of minor fights here. My view is that the low prices tend to attract a pretty hard drinking crowd, but I have to say, I enjoy a pint in here for the real beer and the people watching!"/>
