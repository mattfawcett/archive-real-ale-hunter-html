    I started with a pint of Olivana Best by the recently opened Ilkley brewery.



It was an excellent pintm with a nice strong hop flavour but well balanced.



I then had a pint of the very chocloaty Triple Chocoholic.



They now also have real ciders n the bar, Janets Jungle Juice was available today.

    I tried all 3 guests, all decent brews. They have started selling olives again.

    I had a couple of pints of the Phoenix Spotland Gold, a nice refreshing pale beer.

    I tried all 3 of the guests. The Gamekeeper and Blackberry Cascade were nice but I wasn&#x27;t keen on the Askrigg. It had a strong earthy taste to it. Iv had this beore in the past when I have tried to brew York brewery Yorkshire Terrior kits. I think its to do with bad hops.
