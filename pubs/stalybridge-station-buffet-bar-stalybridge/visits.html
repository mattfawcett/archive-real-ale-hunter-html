      I have family living in Stalybridge so i visit from time to time and normaly have a pleasant time.But this time it was not so good. pubs boarded up some i always call in had no cask beer this on a friday night. The local Wetherspoons came to the rescue with a good choice of cask in top condition, full marks to them. After going for an early meal on the saturday night we went to the Stalybridge Buffet Bar.This bar never lets you down The bar was packed but service was good as the staff work very hard and are always very pleasant.There was a choice of about eight casks and during the night as beers ran out they were promptly changed to a new cask.The atmosphere in the bar is great were you get people from different towns some been on the Real Ale Trail  sometimes noisey but good humered and all went to make a very pleasant evening.

      Popped into the Stalybridge Station Buffet Bar for a couple on the way back from the Winter ales festival in Manchester.



There were 8 ales on in total. The pub was pretty busy when we arrived but calmed down a bit later on

      This has to be one of the best Real Ale pubs there is.There is always something different on each time we visit. After visiting the Stalybridge wetherspoons were halfe of the pumps had no beer on and the two we asked , for were not fit to drink it was great to see a line of good beers waiting to be sampled.I had the White Out from Boggart and then tried the GMT from Three Rivers.We finished off with Holgates New Year and home made meat and potato pie and peas in dish of gravy sat by an open fire.Wetherspoons you have a lot to learn.

      Spent tuesday night in the station bar enjoying taylors bitter. Unlike most pubs mid week the place was very busy ,and the atmosphire was great and the service first class. Why do the pub groups not see that there is no need to try and make all the pubs  the same and leave some to cater for the people  who like to go for a few pints  of good beer meet friends and talk in general.Top marks to the station they will always have our trade when were in the area.

      I knew this pub served some real ale but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this good. I was surprised to see 8 ales and most of them were from small breweries.



If you go past this station its worth going for a pint and getting on the next train.
