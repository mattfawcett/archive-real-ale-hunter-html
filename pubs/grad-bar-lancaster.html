<meta name="description" content="Not your typical student place, Grad Bar is more like a traditional pub. The students are older, being postgraduates.  This was the first student bar to get in The Guide and has been in for eight consecutive years.  Members of the public, particularly real ale and cider lovers, are welcome.  The beers rotate regularly but you can usually expect a range of weak and strong and light and dark ales.  Local beers feature regularly with Barngates appearing most often.  There are usually three or four ciders and perries on with the regular Westons and Gwynt y Ddraig and often another guest.  There is a beer festival in June and a Cider and Perry festival at the end of October. Live music and open mic nights rotate on Thursdays.  7pm - 11pm Mon-Sun and 5pm - 1130pm on Fri (term time)

Get bus numbers X1, 2, 2A, 3, or 4 from Lancaster and ask the nearest student when you get to the campus."/>

    When the Northern went off Barngates Cracker came on :-D and when the Chocaholic went it was replaced by Hawkshead Organic Stout.  The ciders were Gray&#x27;s Medium Dry, Springfield Sledgehammer (8.2% !), Weston&#x27;s Perry and First Quality.  Great live music and I am very drunk.
