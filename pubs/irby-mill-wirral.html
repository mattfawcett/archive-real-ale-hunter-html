<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Irby Mill"/>
<meta name="description" content="Welcome to the Irby Mill - a real country pub. Sandstone and slate outside, warm and inviting inside where a great selection of real cask ales for the beer lover and wholesome homecooked food for our diners awaits. Premium keg beers, lagers and a fine selection of wines complement our drinks offering.
Wherever possible we try to use local produce and suppliers. Our steaks are from Wirral-grazed Aberdeen Angus stock, a local greengrocer supplies all our fruit and vegetables and our succulent sausages are made and supplied by award winning butcher Muffs of Bromborough. Everything is cooked to order and our chips are (probably) the best on the Wirral! Every Sunday we offer a full traditional roast as well as our main menu.
Food service times are 12 - 9pm Monday to Saturday and 12 - 6pm on Sundays.
The Mill is also an ideal starting and stopping-off point on many Wirral walks so be sure to pop in and give us a try next time you're out and about."/>

    Hi,
 
Have just been looking at you excellent website. I am a returnee regular to the Mill following its disastrous recent incarnation as a tapas bar-I predicted to all who would listen that it would close within 6 months-I think I may have been a couple of months out! So firstly, a big thank you for restoring the Mill to much of its former glory-its clear both from the pub itself and from your website that you appreciate the Mills role and potential to be Wirrals finest real ale pub-it always was its unique selling point and is definitely heading back to former glories-its a joy to see the life coming back to the pub-both literally in terms of numbers through the door, but also in a less quantifiable way the pub itself has come to life, thanks to an excellent refurbishment, and the growing number of handpumps! (more please?).
 
The beer has been excellent since your arrival, and the welcome always friendly and warm, like the pub itself. In fact the Youngs Winter Warmer yesterday lunchtime (Wed 6th) went down a treat, as did the Hooky Best on a previous visit - I look forward to visiting tomorrow with my mates-I do hope the Butcombe Brunel IPA is on, but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll force down whatever is on offer! 
 
Thanks again for making the Mill great again-I look forward to regular visits, and we may even get to sit out in the beer garden at some point in the spring or summer!
 
Cheers
Mike
