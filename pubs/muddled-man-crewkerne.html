<meta name="description" content="The Muddled Man is a traditional friendly local’s pub with Cask Marque assured real ales, served on there 3 handpumps featuring 12 different West Country SIBA breweries on rotation .Not only do they have Quality Real Ales but also orffer over, 50 Single Malt Whiskies.
the olso has reasonably priced and good quality food too. Customers can choose from a pub food menu using locally sourced produce with the average main course priced at £8. The proprietors are always keen to use Somerset-reared beef and when that fails, their steak is ordered directly from the Scottish Highlands. This has been so popular that The Muddled Man extends their steak night deal five nights a week, from Sunday to Thursday at £14.50 for two 8oz steaks with all the trimmings. Visitors to The Muddled Man can also expect the same fresh ingredients on the Sunday roast menu with local pork and vegetables served up at the table. Fridays are a treat for everyone with real ale batter fish and chips which go well with a pint  On request, The Muddled Man are happy to cater for vegan dietary requirements and also offer vegetarian dishes on the menu, such as home made vegetable tartlet. Advance bookings are advisable on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and for bigger parties, the skittle alley and function room is available for private hire seating between 10 and 60.   
The Muddled Man is open from 11am to 2.30pm and 7pm to 11pm, Monday to Thursday; 11am to 12pm Friday and Saturday, 12pm to 11pm on Sunday.
