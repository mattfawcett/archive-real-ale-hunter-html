<meta name="description" content="Opening times:(Alcohol only permitted for sale from 11am)



Monday - Friday 7am - 11pm



Saturday - Sunday 8am - 11pm





Food served:



Breakfast - 7am - 11am (Mon-Fri) & 8am - 11am (Sat- Sun)_



Lunch menu - 11am - 5pm (every day)



Evening menu - 5pm - 9pm (every day)



The pub has always been very popular with guests of the shopping centre, but now with even fresher food, better quality ingredients and a more inviting dining experience, TGA has opened up to a greater clientel base from the surrounding area. 



Breakfast is now served daily, thereâ€™s a new Saturday carvery from 12-3pm and even a brand new evening menu.





A much larger proportion of the menu will be high quality, locally-sourced produce, cutting down on food miles and helping to support local agricultural businesses. 



Not just the food is locally sourced - but the real ale offering (3 at any time) is from local micro-breweries & a real cider produced only a few miles away.



With ongoing improvemnets to the whole venue TGA is a haven for all tastes.



Watch out for our Garden BBQâ€™s (weather permitting)

Whatever the time of day, visit The Gardeners Arms & let us take care of you! We offer a warm and family-friendly environment where our guests can sit back and relax whilst our team serve you at your table. Our dishes range from beer battered fish and chips to a traditional (and highly recommended) Steak Pie. 



Colouring books, high chairs, baby changing, baby food and bottle warming facilities are all available to make your dining experience as relaxing & comfortable as possible. 



Due to popular demand we introduced a Sunday carvery which has proved a huge success, enough to add a Saturday carvery from 12-3pm. So, if you havenâ€™t dined with us for a while, bring your family & enjoy what we have to offer.



Chefs specials run daily.
