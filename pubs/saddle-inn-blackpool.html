    Called for lunch after reading previous reviews on this site.  Good service.  Very good beer.  Fabulous food.  Outstanding prices.  So impressed were we that we also called for dinner the same day... same story.  One of my all time favourite pub experiences.

    Once again another great show of guest cask beers.I tried the Morrisay blonde ale which i had never heard of and it was really good.The pub was really busy but the service was good .

    Visited the Saddle this lunchtime mainly to get an image of the pub but decided to have a pint and a sandwich.The bar was a sight for sore eyes with six cask guest beers,most of them i had not seen before as well as the two regular beers Bass and Thwaites.I had a pint of Summer Sunshine which was top class,i was sorry to have to leave after just a pint but we shall return  later in the week and hope there is still some left.
