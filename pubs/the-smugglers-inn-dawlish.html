    Visited The Smugglers Inn at Dawlish on 20/10/2010 and despite all attempts by the Chancellor to cast a gloom over everything, the atmosphere in the pub was fantastic and the beer excellent

Stayed far longer that I should have as the O&#x27;HANLONS YELLOWHAMMER was in magnificent condition, and the sun was shining over Lyme Bay.....bliss....no wonder Devon rhymes with Heaven!
