    Sadly The Alex has closed  again. This within days of The North Foreland and the Railway Tavern both closing and other local pubs under pressure.

Shepherd Neame appear to want to keep the The Alex open and have stated that they are willing to put in a manager as opposed to a tennant landlord. Only time will tell. 

For now this friendly little pub stands in darkness, testament to the slow death of a british tradition.

    Popped in on 5 May 2012, the day after the Alex&#x27;s re-opening night, and despite only popping in for a pint to see what&#x27;s been done with the place, I ended up staying for three and having a good chat the new landlords. I really hope things go to plan for these guys and the re-birth of this lovely old pub can only be a good thing.
