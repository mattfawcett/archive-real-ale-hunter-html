Lynne and Garrett warmly welcome you to their award-winning pub set in the picturesque village of Horton Kirby just outside of Dartford.



Garrett is absolutely fanatical about beer, and prides himself on the reputation he has earnt for serving superbly-kept top-quality ales. His love of great ale has resulted in The Bull being voted the CAMRA Gravesend and Darent Valley Pub of the Year 2008. The 5 or 6 ales on offer (including 1 served on gravity) change constantly, and are sourced from brewers located around the country - making The Bull one of the top spots in the Darent Valley for ale-afficinados.



All of the food served is prepared and cooked on the premises by Lynne using produce from local suppliers. The menu may be small, but with top-quality ingredients such as fresh vegetables from nearby allotments and fish collected from Billingsgate Market, you're assured of traditional, tasty, wholesome pub grub with no airs and graces.
