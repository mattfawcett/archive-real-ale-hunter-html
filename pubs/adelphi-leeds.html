<title>Adelphi - Leeds | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Adelphi"/>
<meta name="description" content="This large pub was bought by Tetleys Brewery in 1960 and was for years the Brewery Tap. The pub is no longer owned by the brewey and has a decent selection of beer. The pub can be pretty quiet at times and can be hired out for private functions. 



As well as the regular and guest real ales that they sell, they also sell Budvar, Erdinger Weissbier, Fruli, Leffe Blonde and Hoegaarden.



Its definitely worth a visit even though it isn't in the busiest part of town. It is on route between the Palace and the Grove. 


I agree with comment above once visted will go back again and again.

    The Adelphi has recently been done out and is nice inside. The pub was very busy (Saturday night) and they now have lots of sofas soutside undercover for the smokers.
