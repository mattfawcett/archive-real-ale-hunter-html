    Called here for our Sunday meal and the pub was busy mainley for food.This is a well run pub and the carvery is good value for money  with a good choice of meats and veg and they have recently added a salad bar.As usual there was only Holts cask beer but i quite like it and the seasonal beers are back this month it is Humdinger,i tried it and it was good but i think i prefer their best bitter.A very nice meal and couple of good pints we will have to visit again soon.

    Called today for our sunday meal and a few drinks. The Holts brewery have stopped brewing their seasonal brews which had become very popular with regular drinkers, the manager could not tell us why but said that they should start again in the summer.We had a very nice roast meal, holts best bitter and to make our day we then watched Man Utd show Chelsea how to play football.

    We spent Sunday afternoon at the mill,it was a warm afternoon and there was a show of Belly Dancers in the square outside the pub,followed by The Alan Bell Band (FOLK MUSIC) The area is tuning up for the very popular Fleetwood Folk Festival which starts in full on friday 29th.There are no guest beers here as it is a tied pub but the Holts beers were on form as usual.and being enjoyed by both diners and drinkers.
