    This was my first visit this year and the pub seems to be doing well. There was only two cask beers on

both were in good condition. The pub was getting quite busy but the staff are good and service was quick.

    The Castle Gardens is a large pub at Carlton just outside Blackpool.There are three cask beers which were all on form when we visited.The staff were very smart and dispensed cask beer just as it should be, The pub is open for food untill nine o clock each day and has a good reputation.
