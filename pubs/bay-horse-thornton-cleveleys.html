    Called in late afternoon  for a meal and hoped that they had a decent guest beer on sale.I was not let down as they had three on  blacksheep bombardier and old peculier,I had  bombardier and then a pint of black sheep, they were both very nice ,but i prefered the bombadier.

    We went to the Bay Horse for tuesdays tea time meal as i had told our friends how the pub had inproved during the past five months with a fair choice of  cask beers. We found a table and i went to the bar to get some drinks.There was a poster at the bar saying cask beer week from the 6th to the 12th of APRIL, but the pumps were not in use.  I asked the barman were the cask beer was and he said you tell me.It looks like the honeymoon is over back to the bad old days.However i must report that the meal was firstclass we all enjoyed it.

    Spent two hours here on friday night,the pub was not as busy as i would have expected.There were three cask beers,Tetley and two guests which were Brains SA and London Pride.We had the Fullers first which was on form,but the Brains was superb so we stayed with it.This pub has improved a lot in the last year,keep up the good work.

    We called in for a meal and a drink, the pub had quite a few customers for early tea time. they had two cask guest beers,i had landlord which was ok but i thought a bit fresh,the service is much inproved,and the meal was very good value.
