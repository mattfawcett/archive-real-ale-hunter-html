<meta name="description" content="The Fox and Hounds public house Knatts Valley Sevenoaks Kent is set in a beautiful english countryside location where hospitality, great quality food and drink and the surroundings are second to none.



\'A wonderful destination pub\'. 



Overlooking the Knatts Valley region and very close to the Pilgrims Way this is an ideal starting and finishing point for a glorious walk/ hike or just to meet friends for a drink or a bite to eat. Ample parking for approx 70 cars! 



We have chosen to offer great pub food at very affordable prices and we pride ourselves on the quality and freshness of our local produce and the fresh fish dishes direct from Folkstone Harbour. Our menu can be browsed, it is changed regulary but keeping the firm favourites. 



In the winter you can snuggle up around the open fire with a jug of winter Pimms or one of our fine real ales, spring and summer you will want to enjoy the beautiful award winning country style garden for that cooling drink in the balmy sun or alfresco dining with that someone special. Weddings and parties can be catered for in a marquee for up to 300 people.



KITCHEN HOURS: Monday - Saturday 12.00-3.00pm 7.00-9.00pm Sunday 12.00 - 4.00pm 



As growing numbers of people move from city to country we demand the same high standards of food and service that we got in the cities. Actually, we demand more because we want it all. We want the service, the quality, the hygiene and on top of that we want freshness, local origin, ethical food production, traditional elements, contemporary elements, quirkiness, fun, a place for the children, value for money, beautiful scenery, a place to dress down, a place to dress up, a place to talk about, activities close by, nice rooms, a place to meet others and so the list goes on. Whatever the reason come to The Fox and Hounds you will not be disappointed.

    What a gem of a pub!!



I found The Fox and Hounds by accident an oasis after a long walk with my wife and dogs. Very dog friendly pub.

We both had a wonderful 2 course lunch which could not be faulted. Great beers and a very good selection of wines available.

The back garden is absolutely fabulous a lot of time and effort has been spent of making sure that we the public enjoy our time there. I would whole heartedly recommend the fox and hounds without hesitation. But do not just take my word for it go visit yourself!!!
