<title>New Beehive Inn - Bradford | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, New Beehive Inn"/>
<meta name="description" content="The 5 gaslit bars are an early example of the â€™Arts and Craftsâ€™ period at the beginning of the last century. The extensive oak panelling, high ceilings, huge mirrors and fine detailing of the Beehive show this popular style to great effect. Three of the rooms have open fires which create with the 58 gas lamps an atmospheric ambience on cold nights. The tap room fire is very large and is a particularly popular room to sample our extensive range of German and Belgian imported beers, a choice of micro-brewed real ales and a large choice of rare malt whiskies. Another feature of the tap room is a picture of the Charabanc Outing in 1910 and the landlord of the time was the great grandfathers of the present landlord, who was the Beehiveâ€™s first landlord! The cellar bar opens at the weekend and offers an opportunity to while away the night until the early hours. The music is a particular attraction and features in particular on world music. Many highly rated bands from around the globe play here."/>
