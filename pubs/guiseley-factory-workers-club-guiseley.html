    This was the first time I have been after hearing quite a lot about it. It was the first beer festival in the back room so the beer selection and quality was excellent.



This is very much like a &#x27;club&#x27; rather than a pub and im not a fan of clubs so probably wouldn&#x27;t go here if there wasn&#x27;t a festival on.
