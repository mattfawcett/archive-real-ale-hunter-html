  Visited the City Gate on Friday 3rd September 2010. Being a Youngs Pub it had a good range of their own beers including the delicious Double Chocolate Stout! 

In addition Fosters, Heineken, Kronenbourg 1664, Guinness, Addlestones Cloudy &amp; Blackthorn Ciders were all on draught.

All the Real Ales tried were in excellent condition and the City Gate rightly deserves its place in the GBG.

It has a fine selection of wines and spirits and a good menu. The food is never less that excellent. 

This is a seriously good Pub/Hotel in a central position close to a multi-storey car park, not far from both Exeter St Davids and Exeter Central Railway Stations and about ten minutes walk from the Bus/Coach Station.

      Added by BENNETTONBEER - 2011


    </h4>
    Paid a visit on Monday 20th September 2010 to check out the City Gates Two-week Beer Festival in the fair city of Exeter.

The normal excellent range of Youngs own brands complimented by a rare appearance on draught of Youngs RAM ROD, plus Sharps COASTER, St Austell PROPER JOB and Wadsworth 6X.

As usual Carl, the bar manager and now acting Hotel Manager keeps the Real Ales in perfect condition and at the correct cellar temperature.

This being so it came as a genuine shock to discover that the local CAMRA branch had NOT put forward the City Gate for inclusion in the GBG 2011.

I am a regular visitor to this pub and I would question their decision.

Therefore I will happily continue to recommend the City Gate to anyone with a love of Real Ale and place this establishment above some of the pubs included in the Guide.
