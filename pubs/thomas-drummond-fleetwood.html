    Called here mid afternoon friday and the pub was quite busy.There was a full bar of cask beers quite a few i had not seen before.My friend had already bought the drinks so i did not know what brew i was drinking and i was surprised to hear that i was drinking  Ruddles Biter.I have to say that the beer was in top condition and then to find out that it is being sold at 99p a pint for a month what a bargin.

    Called in early afternoon after a visit to Fleetwood market.The pub has ten hand pumps eight were in use with a few beers that i had not seen before.I tried a pint of Great Bustard from the Stonehenge Brewery which was quite nice and then Theakstons Old Peculier which was great value at Â£1-59 a pint and in top condition.

    Called in mid afternoon and the pub was quiet but we still had quite a wait as no one seemed to want to serve.The bar had six beers on. and four pumps telling us what they were going to put on if they ever felt like doing it I had a pint of Lancaster Blonde at Â£1-59 and it was on form.

    Called in at lunchtime for  pint, i had a pint of ruddles and my wife had a bottle of sparkling water the cost was Â£2-10p. We had been in our local in Thornton and had the same order with Tetleys instead of Ruddles and a smaller bottle of water the price there was Â£3-90p, and the ruddles was a much better pint.

    Spent our sunday night here with some friends.The bar was very quiet as there were less than twenty people in.The bar normaly closes at midnight  but the barmaid said they were going to close at 11.00.This upset some people as the had transport arranged for  12.15am,they asked to see the manager but as usual he could not be found.They had six guest beers on,i tried the Golden Fox but i think it was the end of the barrel,it was just about drinkable so i went to the IPA which was much better and only 99p a pint.
