<title>George &amp; Dragon - Nelson | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, George &amp; Dragon"/>
<meta name="description" content="The George & Dragon is situated in a village located to the north of Nelson on the A682.  It has 17th and 18th century farmhouses and handloom weavers' cottages alongside the later 19th and 20th century mills.  Pendle Water streams through the centre of the settlement past historic Park Hill, home of the Pendle Heritage Centre and the beginning of the Pendle Way.

Barrowford has a history that can be traced back to Norman Times. For many centuries Barrowford was sparsely populated, - the land too poor for growing crops - and so consisted of a few farms and cottages and the inhabitants managed to scratch a living through rearing sheep and cattle and handloom weaving. Things hardly changed for many centuries, in this, by now, small hamlet.

The Packhorse Bridge is the oldest in Barrowford, dating back to the end of the 16th century.  It formerly lay on the old main road to Gisburn which was superseded by the Turnpike road built in 1804 - directly outside of the pub front door.

In the late Eighteenth Century the invention of steam-power to drive looms arrived, and factories and houses started to spring up, and, in no time at all we had a township. All through the 19th Century and half-way into the twentieth, 'King Cotton' was the Industry that provided the livelihood for most of the folk in Barrowford. From the mid -fifties onwards there was a steady decline in the industry, due to cheap imports from the Far East. Barrowford today is a village that has 'turned its hand' to other skills and is relatively prosperous.
