<title>Number Fifteen - Wigan | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Number Fifteen"/>
<meta name="description" content="Number 15 is based in a small close knit community area, where everybody knows each other. The pub is situated on a busy main road, close to local amenities. 

The pub is warming and attractive from the outside, recently being repainted giving the pub an uplift. Inside there is a lot of character with a very unique feel. Many various styles of mirrors and tasteful pictures cover the walls throughout the pub giving the customers something to look at and admire. There is also a wide range of furniture around the pub, giving the customers a choice according to their own given comfort, allowing them to relax and enjoy their time in the pub. The lighting has quite an ambient feel to it and is very homely. We dim the lights at the night time to give a more cozy feel to the pub.

Many customers during the 
daytime gather regularly here, 
spend time together like a 
family, enjoying each others 
company and banter, with the 
compliment of friendly, attentive, 
and professional staff. In the 
evening more couples and 
groups visit Fifteens to 
celebrate or just spend time 
together having a relaxing drink."/>
