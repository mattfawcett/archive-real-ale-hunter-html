    I happily paid a visit to this charming old pub on the afternoon of the 24th August 2010. 

As usual the welcome was warm, the food excellent and both the Real Ales on draught, DOOMBAR and DARK NESS were in excellent condition. 

I can think of few pubs better to spend an evening in good company. 

Thoroughly recommended.
