'Dating back to the 11th Century and once a coaching inn. The Pied Bull is the oldest continuously licensed premises in Chester. It has a colourful history and its fair share of ghosts. The cellar is  haunted by the ghost of a cellar man from 1609 and two guest rooms are haunted by a chamber maid from 19th Century.  In 1533 it was known as Bull Mansion, and a coach and four started to run from here to Birkenhead in 1784. Today it's an oak-beamed town centre pub with rooms. We offer great value food and clean, comfortable and competitively priced accommodation. A potted history of the pub taken from George Borrows' 'Wild Wales' is written on a blackboard in the restaurant.'

Also serves really good food and has their own brewery. Camra Pub of the Year 2011."/>

    Went in on a Saturday summer&#x27;s afternoon. Charming little place. Had a really good meal and the ale was on top form too. A must visit if in Chester.
