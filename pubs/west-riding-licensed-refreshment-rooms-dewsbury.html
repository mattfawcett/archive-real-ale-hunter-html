    I think even tumble weed would be a welcome addition to this pub... What a waste. It used to be such a great place to go. Now there is no atmosphere, no regulars &amp; no familiar faces behind the bar anymore. There aren&#x27;t even as many ale trailers getting through the doors as there used to be. Mexican food???? Really??!!! This was meant to be a real ale pub, last thing anyone wants is a fajita with a pint of best!!! If I wanted to be served and yapped at by kids I&#x27;d go to McDonalds... but then again maybe I should as service is better!! Grotty, mismanaged, over priced, sweaty dump. Full of junkies and pot heads. Do yourself a favour and keep on going past this dump or avoid. There are better pubs like the Navigation in Mirfield or Leggers in Savilletown where you get proper beer and a good welcome.

    This has to be one of the worst pubs I have ever visited. On arrival i was tempted to have something to eat, that was until i saw an old lady from the kitchen hunched over smoking in her apron outside - nice! How very hygienic! Large noisy groups most likely stag parties were messing about and people smoking marijuana front and back of the pub it was disgraceful. The toilets were like a swamp,Bogged in urine and the only gents cubicle was covered in sick. The  beer had turned and there were people even smoking in the gents. Not that the staff were helpful in the slightest. I asked a young lad about the beers available and he said he was just paid to pour them not to talk about them!
