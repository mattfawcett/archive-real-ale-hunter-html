    Quite a while since we have called here but we thought we would try another visit.

The bar was quite busy and there was a choice of four cask beers.We all went for the youngs which was on 

form but then went for the blonde which was just as good.A good start to our night out.

    We spent sunday lunch in the Euston lounge bar,there

were four guest beers  on sale i drank the premier while my friends had the broadside, There was a good jazz band playing and the bar was pretty full.I think we will visit again on a sunday.
