<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Abbey Inn"/>
<meta name="description" content="This pub is a hidden away gem that isn't very well known but is a good place to get a decent pint. The pub is on a little road that on a map looks like it is just off Kirkstall road but when you try and get directions from the AA or Google website it gives you then going a long way round. We did have a quick drive to see if you can drive from the pub to Kirkstall road but it seemed to be blocked off.

The route from Kirkstall Road is pedestrians only due to a C19 bridge over the river.  10 min.s walk from the bus stop on Kirkstall road.  Service 33/33A every 10 min.s from Leeds centre Mon-Sat daytime.


Anyway they have 6 hand pumps featuring beers from Copper Dragon, Saltaire and Old Bear as well as other guests. 



They occasionally host beer festivals and regularly have some form of live entertainment on. Tuesdays is Jam Night.

There's an outside seating area.
