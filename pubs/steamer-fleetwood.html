    A early evening visit to the Steamer to see what guest beers were on the bar.I had a pint of Nimmos xxxx which i enjoyed, and then tried the Rasberry ale from Caledonian which was excellent.

    Called in the steamer for our friday lunch and to meet some friends. Three new beers on so i tried a pint of St Austell and could not fault it. The standard of the cask beers in this pub are a credit to the Landlord and his staff.

    The pub is back to six beers,which is good to 

see .I ,tried the Old Mill and then went to Youngs which is a very nice pint.We seem to see more of Youngs in our area now maybe its because they are involved with Wells brewery as Bombardier seems to be on the list of most pub groups.

    Started our sunday evening at the steamer. The pub was very quiet and down to one guest beer.The pub seems to have lost it way,maybe the,present financial climate is causing problems. I hope it can recover,as it is the last pub left were you had a good choice of cask beers in Fleetwood besides the dreded WETHERSPOONS, it sure looks bleak.
