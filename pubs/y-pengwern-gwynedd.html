<meta name="description" content="A village hotel and pub owned by the community, for the community!
The village of Ffestiniog lost its last pub when the previous owners closed it down in 2009. The community were concerned that it would go the way of many other pubs, and be bought by a property developer to be lost forever. 
In the spring of 2009 a group of locals got together to raise the funds to buy the hotel and run it as a community venture. By June 2011 the group had raised the money and bought the hotel as a Free House. The bar and function room are up and running, the kitchen is nearly ready to open (by summer 2012) Plans are in place to refurbish and re-open the letting rooms as funds allow.
The Pengwern supports local businesses and therfore the main beers stocked are locally brewed. The main brewery used is the closest, Purple Moose brewery of Porthmadog, but the pub also regularly stocks beers from other local breweries such as Conwy and Great Orme. These are often supplemented by beers from further afield. The Pengwern only has 2 pumps at the moment, so all breweries and beers listed are not always available, more pumps may be added as volumes of sales dictate.

The Community's vision:

to buy and re-open the Pengwern and to develop it as a community venture. It will belong to the community and will be run democratically by the community and for the benefit of the community.


To run and develop the Pengwern as an environmental, economic, social, educational and cultural asset for the benefit of the community. Pengwern Cymunedol will be a sustainable community venture that will contribute to the regeneration of the wider area through example and training. 


To offer local opportunities for work, also resources and support for entrepreneurship, training and education, especially in the catering, hospitality, tourism and outdoor pursuits areas.  


To encourage local social and cultural activities with the emphasis on the use of the Welsh language. 


To create amenities and opportunities for the youth of the area.

  
To encourage green tourism and to offer a warm Welsh welcome to visitors. 


To place an emphasis on the use of quality local produce and services.


To consult and work with other community ventures such as â€˜Antur Stiniogâ€™, in order to integrate development of the local community enterprise sector. 


The broader vision is that Pengwern Cymunedol will be a key contributor to wider changes, i.e. to nurture community enterprise and a new social economy within Wales. "/>
