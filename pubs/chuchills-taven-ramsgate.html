<title>Chuchills Taven - Ramsgate | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Chuchills Taven"/>
<meta name="description" content="The building was originally the Isabella Baths, built in 1816 on land that was part of St. George's Fields, with bathing in sea or fresh waters at a variety of different temperatures.



In 1868 it was converted to a boarding house and later into the Paragon Hotel, incorporating shops, a restaurant, a licensed bar and the Paragon Corner House tea rooms.



In 1961 Tomson and Wotton, the Ramsgate brewers, took over the corner house and re-furbished it in a Victorian style.  It became the Van Gogh Pub.  New owners in 1983 packed the pub with a vast array of junk and renamed it Steptoe's after the Rag and Bone man from the popular T.V show.



After being bought by the current owner in 1988, the interior was stripped and then re-constructed as a typical English country Inn, while using only genuine materials from local sources.



Floors were raised and the ceilings were lowered, using Oak beams some 200-300 years old, saved from derelict houses and barns in the weald of Kent.



By using the original craftsman's peg and wedge method, virtually no nails were used in the construction.  The bar was assembled from Oak Pews from the Romney Marsh, believed to be over 200 years old.  The wall panelling was also made from pews salvaged from an old church building.



The bricks were all re-claimed from demolished houses while the stained glass windows in the screens were re-made from the original Victorian windows of the building which were found in the attic.



Maintaining the authenticity, the walls were hung with an interesting collection of genuine agricultural implements and rural crafting tools and on cold days the open log fire adds a warm glow to the atmosphere."/>
