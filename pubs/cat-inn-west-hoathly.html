    Visited on a Saturday lunchtime and the place had a good buzz about it. Most people were eating from a small but very accomplished menu. All food fresh and home-cooked to a high standard. Beer on superb form; just as the brewer intended! Harveys best bitter also available although not tried on this occasion. Great pub with lots of character without the dodgy characters.
