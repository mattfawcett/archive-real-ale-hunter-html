    </h4>
    Another Sunday visit. Once again, the same young lady was serving behind the bar, and as always the service was cheerful, polite, and faultless. Also, (once again), for those spoilt by the choice of beers, advice, and tasters were offered graciously. (If only all hostelrys were like this!)
    <h4>

    </h4>
    This visit was conducted on a Friday night, the bar was very busy, and once again the atmosphere was very friendly, and amicable.

The two bar staff, (one of whom was the young lady encountered on the previous, quiet, Sunday visit), were &quot;on top of the job&quot;, pleasant, professional, and the epitomy of what one would expect from a &quot;local&quot;. Excellent!

    </h4>
    A tad quieter than a week day, (Visited on a Sunday), the atmosphere was in no way compromised, with the patrons engaging in an entertaining banter, and newcomers being welcomed and brought into the conversation.

The (as always), friendly bar person, was attentive, and professional, and willing to offer help to those who were undecided by the interesting choice of real ales available,

FIRST CLASS!
