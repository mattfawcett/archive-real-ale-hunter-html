    A group of 6 of us dropped in on Saturday lunchtime and were well fed &amp; watered. I can recommend the &#x27;greasy spoon special&#x27; of sausage, chips, beans and (optional) gravy as well as the Copper Dragon Black Gold.

    Thorne Best and Leeds Midnight Bell in Arcadia

    I had 3 ales in Arcadia. The stout was very nice and flavoursome. Space by Elland brewery was a nice strong ale (around 5.6%).



I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the Yorkshire Pale (it had a slight mushroomy taste and smell to it)

    I tried each of the guests in the pub and all very very nice. I also took a 2 pint \&quot;real ale takeaway\&quot; with me of Guzzler
