    Spent a couple of hours here on our day out.There were eight cask beers on the bar we tried three of them and all were on form although the Lees guest beer was quite bland not as good as the Lees
brews we are used to.

    Another good visit to the White Bull a pub that never lets you down with their choice of cask beers.There were five guests on today, i had a pint of Mordue which was on top form.

    A busy pub with a great choice of guest cask beer on the bar.The staff are top class and always serve a good pint and always in top condition.I had the Breakspear bitter and then Burton bitter both could not have been better.

    This pub goes better each time we visit.The choice of guest beers is first class and are dispensed with care  to give you a full pint as it should be.The pub was very busy today with people waiting for a table to have their Sunday lunch,and the locals drinking the top class beer and watching the football on the tele. This pub is well worth finding ,if you do i am sure you will not be  disapointed.

    Called at the Bull on our way home from our trip to Lancaster,and had time for a pint before our transport arrived. We all had John Willies Bitter which seems to get better every time the landlord puts it on
