<meta name="description" content="Ye Olde George Inne has undergone some great improvements over the last few months including a fantastic new head Chef and complete re-vamp of the menus to give our customers a much larger and varied menu with fresh daily produce coming from local suppliers. Our menus can be browsed here.



Pubs In Shoreham



The George has been the focal point of the village for over 400 years and is steeped in history and folklore, reportedly to be one of the most haunted pubs in the country!







The MAIN bAR has been opened up to make a much more inviting area to meet friends for lunch, dinner or just to drink. We have a good selection of Draught beers and Ales, resident ales include Harvey's Sussex Best Bitter and Hogs Back Brewery TEA(Traditional English Ale)With Guest ales coming from a variety of brewers such as Westerham, Cottage, Pilgrims and The Whitstable brewery, to name but a few. We also have draught, bottled lagers and ciders available, in addition to these we have a very good selection of wines & Champagne to suit most palettes. Our range of premier crus and reserve wines from the firm favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Germany are always available with some fantastic new age wines coming online to tantalize your tastebuds, along with fine cognacs and brandy. 



Pubs In Shoreham



The newly refurbished restaurant is still within keeping in the traditional style of a 500 year old building, our menus are changed on a regular basis along with the seasonal foods that are locally sourced menu. From mouth watering steak or game pies to delicious fresh fish including the firm favourite cod and chips, and why not try our Pan-fried breast of duck with blueberry and pomegranate? 

Later in the year the banqueting and function suite will be open for weddings and family celebrations in the sympathetically restored out-buildings and barn. 



Pubs In Shoreham



Our Head Chef Pat Burrows our very experienced head chef runs the kitchens at The George with help from his hand picked team. During the balmy summer months why not sit out in the courtyard for lunch or throughout the winter months have a wonderful intimate dinner in front of the open fires, or meet with friends and family? It is advisable to book your table as we are very busy at peak times.

We hope you enjoy coming to The George @ Shoreham
