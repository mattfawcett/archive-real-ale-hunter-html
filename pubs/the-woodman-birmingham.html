<title>The Woodman - Birmingham | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Woodman"/>
<meta name="description" content="The pub is open every day from 11am until 11pm (Midnight Friday and Saturday). Food is served every day from 11am until 8pm (6pm Sundays), we are already renowned for our excellent home-made burgers and hand-cut chips! As well as our regular beers and guest ales we offer a Real Ale of the Day, constantly changing at only £2.70 a pint. A range of lagers is available with Revisionist Craft Lager available at £2.70 a pint. We have a regular quiz every Wednesday from 7.30. Entry is free for teams of up to 6 and there is a gallon of beer to be won.

The Woodman is a Grade II listed building which was built in 1897 for Ansell's Brewery. It was designed by renowned Birmingham architects James and Lister Lea in ornate brick and terracotta. Both the Bar and Smoke Room are tiled throughout in Minton tiles and the bar counter and back fitting are pretty much intact.

The pub stands opposite the very grand Curzon Street Station which was the original station as the railway line from London reached Birmingham. Whilst the immediate area has been a virtual wasteland for some years both the station and the Woodman have survived.

The area has now seen a renaissance as the first stage of Eastside Park has opened, surrounding the pub in handsome granite paving and avenues of trees.

The Woodman has been very down at heel for some years, has had several periods of closure and a number of question marks over its very survival. But this pub is a true survivor.

The future of this fine establishment now seems assured with its takeover by Birmingham Inns and Linford Developing Heritage. The original features of the pub have been restored whilst up to date toilet and kitchen facilities have been added.
