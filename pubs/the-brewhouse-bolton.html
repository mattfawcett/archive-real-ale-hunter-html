<title>The Brewhouse - Bolton | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Brewhouse"/>
<meta name="description" content="The Brewhouse is everything you would desire from a local inn and restaurant â€“ superb freshly prepared food, a wide selection of beers, cask ales, wines and spirits, en suite accommodation â€“ we even have our own brewery on show within the pub.
 
Formerly the Cheetham Arms, the premises benefitted from a major investment in July 2009 and now present fully refurbished and attractive accommodation throughout. The new bar offers a focal point for discerning drinkers keeping an eye on the activities within the brewery and two rooms off the main lounge offer an intimate and cozy dining experience.
 
All our dishes are freshly prepared on the premises by an enthusiastic team of young chefs who all share a passion for traditional and modern British cuisine and who insist on using the finest locally sourced ingredients.
 
The micro brewery produces a range of cask ales that are permanently available in the pub. Brewing normally takes place every week when the heady aroma of mashing malt and boiling hops adds to the convivial atmosphere.

â€œThe fish was huge, the chips real, the tartare sauce homemade and the best I've ever hadâ€

â€œAll in all, the Brewhouse is one of the best gastro pubs I have ever been to and is well worth a visitâ€

â€œEverybody was really friendly & helpful. The room was immaculate and comfortable...I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again when in the area.â€ (laterooms.com)
