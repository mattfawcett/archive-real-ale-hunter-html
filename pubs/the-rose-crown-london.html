<title>The Rose &amp; Crown - London | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Rose &amp; Crown"/>
<meta name="description" content="The Rose and Crown is a traditional English pub located in the historic area once known as the Paris Garden, mentioned by Shakespeare in Henry VIII. The building dates back to the 16th century. During the blitz bombings of World War II the pub survived miraculously undamaged while most of the surrounding area was flattened.

We offer a friendly atmosphere amid classic dÃ©cor. The large grassy beer garden is lined with hop and wisteria trellises, a beautiful sunny spot for launching and having a drink or three!

There is always an excellent range of award winning real ales including Spitfire, Masterbrew, Kentâ€™s best and a selection of seasonal and guest ales as well. Available on draught are Guiness, Holsten export, Oranjeboom, and Strongbow. We also have a good range of fine wines by the glass or bottle. During lunch hours Rose and crown offers a wide range of world wide food & specials along with Great British Pub Grub, sandwiches and baguettes.

On the first floor there is a function room, which holds 30 seated and 60 standing, available to hire for birthday, leaving and retirement parties, business meetings and quiz nights. A number of film shoots have been previously done in this room. "/>
