      After adding my previous comments I went to look at the website for the group that own this pub. Try this little game... Go to their website at http://www.vintageinn.co.uk/ and type your postcode in.  Then click on a pub, read the PR blurb, look at the pictures and then go back and click on another pub, notice any difference?  No, neither did I...

      To say that I was underwelmed by the experience might give this pub more credit than it deserves.

I actually managed to download a note pad programme for my smartphone and learn how to use it to make notes whilst waiting for service at various times during the evening.

It isn&#x27;t really a Real Ale pub, it&#x27;s a pub that has a couple of hand pulled beers on tap.

It does food, but I would not recommend the experience. On a quiet Tuesday it seemed to take ages before anyone served me at the bar and the service for food upheld this poor quality standard.

The food, when it came, was nothing to write home about. The carrots were cold and undercooked, the Hot Pot was over seasoned and some of the meat definately on the chewy side of underdone.

Someone really should advise the staff not to make comments about colleagues in the hearing of customers as well...

After asking for the bill, long wait, I asked for a VAT receipt and whilst again waiting, I watched the waiter spend several minutes messing with the TV remote control.  So, I got up, put my coat on and waited by the bar whilst the same waiter dealt with another customers payment details.  All whilst most of the pub was empty, and now I know why.

If you are away from home want a decent pint and some good food then avoid the Kettykil Fox would be my advice.
