      Called in mid afternoon and the pub was quiet but we still had quite a wait as no one seemed to want to serve.The bar had six beers on. and four pumps telling us what they were going to put on if they ever felt like doing it I had a pint of Lancaster Blonde at Â£1-59 and it was on form.

      Called in at lunchtime for  pint, i had a pint of ruddles and my wife had a bottle of sparkling water the cost was Â£2-10p. We had been in our local in Thornton and had the same order with Tetleys instead of Ruddles and a smaller bottle of water the price there was Â£3-90p, and the ruddles was a much better pint.

      Spent our sunday night here with some friends.The bar was very quiet as there were less than twenty people in.The bar normaly closes at midnight  but the barmaid said they were going to close at 11.00.This upset some people as the had transport arranged for  12.15am,they asked to see the manager but as usual he could not be found.They had six guest beers on,i tried the Golden Fox but i think it was the end of the barrel,it was just about drinkable so i went to the IPA which was much better and only 99p a pint.

      Visited the beer festival if that is what Witherspoons call it. The pub is a disgrace,there are over ten handpumps on the bar only four were in use, out of them the best they could offer was  Marstons Pedigree, plus three cloudy bitters which my friends took back and changed for Pedigree, The staff are not trained there is never a manager there so different to the two Witherspoons in Lancaster which are well managed and good value for money.
