    First stop during a short pub crawl round York. I had a pint of the Porter to start with and then had a pint of Fat Cat Honey Ale with my Fish and Chips.

Ale was on top from as always with the Maltings and food was nice too.

    I had a pint of Union Flag 1606 which was my first pint of the day and very nice. We also got  a bowl of their very chunky chips.

    We went here after going to the york beer festival. Unfortunatly we were just a bit too late for food.

    This was the third pub in our tour of York and I had a pint of Silver Creek which was very Tasty. This was the second time we have been to this pub and we decided to try the food. We had Fish and Chips and were very impressed by the amount that we got.
