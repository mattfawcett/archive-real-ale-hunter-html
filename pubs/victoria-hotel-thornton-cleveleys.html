    </h4>
    We had a small pub crawl around the area and i have to say the standard of cask beer was very poor untill we arrived at the Victoria. The standard here could not be better polite management and staff and well looked after cask beer at under Â£1-60 a pint which saved our day.

    </h4>
    Only one cask beer on here as the pub is a Smiths tied house. The cask was on top form and is now priced at Â£1-59 a pint a rise of 15p in over two years great value.

    Paid our monthly visit to the Victoria to find that the cask beer price had been increased to Â£1-44 a pint, we had two pints each and the ale was on great form.

    </h4>
    No guest beers as this is a tied house,but the pub is well known for its Old Brewery Bitter at Â£1-38 a pint which was on form as usual. There has just been a change of manager, so we are hoping the new one can keep the high standard we have been used to.
