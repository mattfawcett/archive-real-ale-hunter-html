    <h4>
      Added by matt - over 10 years ago


    </h4>
    This is the first time I have been to the Duck and Drake on a Saturday night and I was very pleasently surprised. 11 ales were server and there were a band on in the main room that sounded good. The pub was busy but not too rammed and the beer was on top form.



I will be making more of an effort to go here in the future.

    This is my second visit to this pub. The last time I went was over a year ago. I just had to see whether the 16 ales advertised were true. They were to some extent as they had the ones I have listed and a couple of regulars(Landlord and Theakstons). There are 10 pumps in the main bar and 6 in the back bar but not all were in use.



I shall have to go in at the weekend and see how many beers are on then.



I had a Whistlestop and a Slain, both good brews
