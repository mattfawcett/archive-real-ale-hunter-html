      Nice to see the pub is still open but now its gone all wierd. I have seen that they say they have spent Â£45,000 on the garden update.......what on I ask myself. Most of what they have put in could have been bought from B&amp;Q for about Â£4000 in total so where has the rest of it been spent
Previous review says 6 real ale pumps, yes but only 2 or 3 have beer coming out of them and the quality is really quite average but the price would suggest top quality.
A soaking wet springer spaniel came running through the lounge and we were sat at a tble near the fire and got soaked when it shook itself. Not sure if its the owners or not but food was being served.

      We visited on the 8th April for there Garden party. The new beer garden is amazing and has obviously had a lot of money invested in to it. There are a good selection of real ales on and the Hobgoblin was especially nice, Served in a very nice Hobgoblin glass.
They have a pie menu thats pretty darn good with some that you would not normally think of trying. They are award winning for a reason. They also have a normal pub menu which my wife had which was nice. They had a live band which had a great interaction with the crowd. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. All in all a lovely pub in a picturesque location.
