<meta name="description" content="LEEDS CAMRA 'PUB OF THE YEAR 08/09'



Mr Foley's was opened in November 2007 in the ownership of York Brewery.



This pub has a good selection of guest beers on offer and also does a fair few foreign beers on tap including Peroni, Leffe, Morakva (british brewed, unpasturised czech lager) Krombacher Pils and Belle Vue. They also have a selection of over 25 bottled beers such as Sierra Nevada, Chimay and Brooklyn. The pub is a weird shape being on many different levels. There is the bar area at the bottom, and a raised seating area about 4 foot. Then on a slightly lower level is the back room which is very big with a few comfy sofas. This used to be the no smoking area before the ban and is sometimes closed off when there is a private function in there. There is also a small balcony/seating area that is over the bar.



Food is served daily until 7PM



All major sporting events are shown on 3 large screens and live music can be found on occasional sunday evenings."/>
