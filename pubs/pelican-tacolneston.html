<meta name="description" content="The Pelican.
The Pelican is a traditional Norfolk pub and local real ale shop, with an adjoining restaurant and en-suite bed and breakfast accommodation. We are located just 15 minutes south of the historical city of Norwich, in the quaint village of Tacolneston near Wymondham, south Norfolk. 

Our traditional pub is one of Norfolkâ€™s oldest inns, with its history dating back to the 16th century. Since becoming its owners 11 years ago, we have lovingly and sympathetically restored the building and its surroundings, remaining full of character and charm becoming one of Norfolkâ€™s most popular destination pubs and eateries in the area.

The pub itself comprises of soft leather sofas, stone floors, old oak beams and a large open fire place, we believe in home comforts and want our customers to feel relaxed, well looked after and comfortable in their surroundings whether drinking, dining or frequenting our B&B.

Although the pub itself is well known for its â€˜simple British cuisineâ€™ The pelican is fully licensed and renowned for its large variety of wines, beers, malts and traditional real ales and as a free-house, we have the added bonus of being able to keep our prices affordable. 

In recent years, we have been highly reviewed and awarded for the consistency of quality and service for our real ale and currently offer four local and national hand pulls. Within our new real ale shop, we support 31 Norfolk & Suffolk breweries by showcasing an impressive 90 local real ale bottles to take away. Every year we also hold a number of beer festivals where customers are given the opportunity to drink from a variety of local and national real ales and ciders. 

Since winning South Norfolk Pub of The Year Award, The Pelican inn  has been encouraged by its local custom to strive and succeed in becoming â€˜more than just a pubâ€™ by offering its customers the chance to take home some of the delights of Norfolk. 
Our new Norfolk real ale and local produce shop not only supports our local 31 Norfolk and Suffolk breweries, but also offers a range of other specialist local produce such as relishes, chutneys and preserves, ciders, lagers, oils, Norfolk cheeses, homemade desserts and chocolates. All of which can be sold separately to take away or can be combined as gift hampers for special presents. 
At the moment the shop opening times are the same as the pub, however we have hopes in the not too distant future to provide a â€˜buy onlineâ€™ ordering and delivery service across the whole of the UK.

    WOW what an excellent pub! driving from Norwich for a day trip out and came across this little treasure. what a fantastic pint infact so good we ended up staying for more real ale from the four hand pumps and got a taxi home! my friend and i ate an exceptional traditional sunday roast then browsed at the local real ale bottle shop with over 105 bottles of local brew. a fabulous little pub, warm, friendly and great beer. without a doubt we will definately be returning on a regular basis.
