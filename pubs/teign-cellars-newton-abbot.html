    Now moved up the road and now a craft beer bar, the bottle shop is still there but now you can drink in. 4 cask and 6 keg taps serving the best beers from around the world. Good ambience and knowledgable staff who will offer tastings. Food looks great and the scotch eggs are huge!! Great new bar in Newton Abbot and looking to get better!

    Visited on Saturday night. Fantastic hoppy IPAs and an amazing Chocolate Stout to end the evening. Also a wonderful Pork and Paprika Scotch Egg!
So happy there is a world class pub so close to me - can&#x27;t wait for my next visit...

    I had the pleasure of attending the invitation only party the day before the Teign Cellars official opening.

Wow, was I impressed and not just because of the free food!  This is a fantastic opportunity for locals and visitors alike to sample great craft/artisan beers from around the world.

The atmosphere was great and the omens appear to be very good.

The Teign Cellars is situated on East Street just off the main shopping area, quite close to the Railway Station and Bus stops and not far from that other justly famous watering hole...the Cider Bar.

This is a superb pub and the range of bottled and gravity beers complemented those on draught, there being so many I forgot to record them all, well at least that&#x27;s my excuse!

This is certainly a must visit pub...so drink to that
