    Stuck with the Bombardier, not a bad pint, good earthly taste from the Fuggles. A friend had a problem with a malfunctioning Pedigree, he took it back and got it changed by sympathetic barstaff, apparently it was &#x27;water&#x27; in the line as they&#x27;d just cleaned them, hmm nice.



I ordered the mixed grill, it arrived very quickly and wasn&#x27;t bad at all, and of course being a &#x27;Spoons&#x27; it was cheap as chips, which you also got with the grill.
