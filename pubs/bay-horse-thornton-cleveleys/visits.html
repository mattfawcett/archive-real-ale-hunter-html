      We went to the Bay Horse for tuesdays tea time meal as i had told our friends how the pub had inproved during the past five months with a fair choice of  cask beers. We found a table and i went to the bar to get some drinks.There was a poster at the bar saying cask beer week from the 6th to the 12th of APRIL, but the pumps were not in use.  I asked the barman were the cask beer was and he said you tell me.It looks like the honeymoon is over back to the bad old days.However i must report that the meal was firstclass we all enjoyed it.

      Called in on Christmas eve, and the pub was very busy.Loads of staff on duty in fancy dress even had waiters which is a thing of the past. Two guest beers on London Pride,and Spitfire both in good condition we had a good evening. I dont know what has brought about  this welome change for the better, maybe the fact that two of the few pubs that the Orchid  group own in this area were  closed down indefenatly this week.

      Yes after saying that i would not use the pub again i went again with my wife and two off her friends for a meal. The meal was good and the service was better than the last time i visited,They had two guest beers,London Pride and Marstons Pedigree.I had a pint of london pride which was first class  and then tried the pedigree which i could not fault,maybe if the beer stayed like this there is a chance the pub could return to somthing like its past glory.Only time will tell.

      We said we would not drink here again, but with all the rain we decided to try again. We had a pint of the guest beer Rev James which was just about drinkable. The pub is very clean  and a lot brighter since the refurb ,but one pint was enough, and we left  and went to the Victoria(Sam Smiths)
