<title>The Old Cock - Otley | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Old Cock"/>
<meta name="description" content="Recently opened Freehouse Real-ale pub, a bijou establishment, (small in laymans terms !) with an upstairs area that concentrates solely on its ales and aims at the over 25 market.
Wide selection of daily changing beers, continental lagers and farmhouse ciders are on offer all reasonably priced, not Sam Smith cheap but sensibly priced.
 Lee, the owner usually has 7 or 8 fresh ales on as well as a staple 3 knockout ciders at around the 7% mark.. Not for the faint hearted. 
Timmermans draught Raspberry beer and other 'proper' continentals both draught and bottled adorn the range, beware of Kwak at its eyewatering content ready to floor the unweary. 
Theakstons and Tets are the staple beers but there is such a wide range of beers ever changing on sale here that its difficult to pin a regular. Its great to see local breweries in Albion Street, Otley (literally a 3 minute walk away), Meanwood Ridgeside and the ever increasingly popular WharfeBank In Pool being supported. my fave is the Tether Blonde. Many other independants beers are sold here too.
The pub is named in honour of the Landlords Cock !! He keeps chickens you see...
No fruit machines, no tv, no juke box.. Just proper beers and conversation though live festival type music are planned.

There is a nice little real ale walk developing in this part of Otley. The Manor and The Junction are both well deserving of a call in.
Recently opened means a prompt 11pm shut but  I have to say this place is a great and welcome addition to the Otley drinking scene.

Just a word of warning for the 6ft plus amongst us,  mind your head going in and using the toilet its about a 5ft 11' clearance..!!!
