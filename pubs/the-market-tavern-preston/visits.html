      We called here on our day in Preston and were disgusted by the standard of cask beer being served, and the attitude of the woman in charge.Good brews like Everards sold like cold tea,cloudy you could not see in it never mind through it. When i returned it to the bar she said she would change it but other people were drinking it and had not complained.She gave me two pints of a cask called Jazz i had not heard of this brew but as i picked them up i could smell  it was off i had a small taste it was sour, and we left it on the table.As we  were leaving she said that she had sold us real ale and that was what it should be like, as a landlord for thirty eight years i fear for todays pubs its not just the greedy   pub companies who are killing the pubs but the untrained managers and saff who run them as well.
