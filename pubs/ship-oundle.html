<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Ship"/>
<meta name="description" content="Upon entering the inn, new customers are immediately charmed by the low hanging ceiling, original oak beams and large inglenook fireplace. The Ship is listed in The Good Beer Guide and provides a fine selection of real ales to choose from.  There are 3 real ales, the permanent is from the local Digfield Brewery with two other ever chenging guests.



A great atmosphere and great food at certain times of the day.



Lounge bar



The lounge bar is located to the left of the main entrance and features a homely, roaring fireplace and extensive menu offering a wide range of delicious home made meals prepared daily.



Public side bar



The casual side bar located to the right of the main entrance features leather couches, juke box and fruit machine â€“ a great place to enjoy a relaxed, social drink.



Patio bar



Located at the rear of the pub, the patio bar accompanies a large outdoor seating area, always busy during the summer months. Live music and DJ's feature regularly in the bar at weekends.
