<title>The Inn on the Green - Bristol | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Inn on the Green"/>
<meta name="description" content="Opened five years ago, and still currently owned by Oliver Bainbridge, the Inn on the Green has been quoted in Venue as the 'Jewell in the crown of the north Bristol pub scene.' It has slowly but surely developed into Bristol's finest real ale house and provides one of the city's premier pub dining menus. Now under the management of Joe Cook, working with talented head chef Owen Tunstall, the Inn on the Green boasts up to fifteen real ales, five ciders or perries and a regularly changing, exciting and brilliantly executed menu. With an emphasis on informed and friendly service, high quality real ale and food, a conviction to its integrity and a loyalty to its locals rarely seen in pubs today, the pub has become an institution in north Bristol. As a previous winner of the prestigious CAMRA pub of the year award, and numerous entries in the Good Beer guide, The Inn on the Green can really be seen as the place to be for any real ale or good food lover.
