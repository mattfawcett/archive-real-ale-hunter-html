    Just along the seashore from Port Bannatyne Marina this great Russian bar/restaurant provides just what you need after a day or two at sea. Warm, comfortable, great food, excellent beers and a good atmosphere. Lots of foreign tourists were there and all were very impressed at the Russian way of doing things. Can&#x27;t help but hope it rubs off on the Scots!!
