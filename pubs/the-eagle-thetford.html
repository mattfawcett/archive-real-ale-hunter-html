<title>The Eagle - Thetford | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Eagle"/>
<meta name="description" content="The Eagle is my home from home. When I'm visiting from Leicester I always manage to find my way to the Eagle. 

Aaron is a proper landlord. He supports the local community, runs a football team on a Sunday and is an all round good egg but most of all he serves good beer.

As for the beer, well there's normally at least 5 real ales in addition to a selection of lagers plus Aspall's cider.

Recently I've enjoyed Timothy Taylor, Adnams Steam amongst others, in fact I can't think of a bad beer that Aaron has served.

The locals are a really friendly bunch and most nights you can find someone to talk to at the pub.

There's always something going on and with food on Friday's, Saturdays & Sundays this is well on the way to being the complete local.

I just wish the Eagle was where I live in Leicester and I'd be there every night.
