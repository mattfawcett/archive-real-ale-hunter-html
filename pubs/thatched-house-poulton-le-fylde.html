    A visit on our trip to Poulton tried the Three Bs first at 3.8 and it was a nice drink,i then had the Flat cap from Bank Top which was on top form i could have stayed on that but it was time to move on.

    The selection of cask beers on sale i thought was poor.i had a pint of Flat Cap which was ok and then the copper dragon bitter which was disapointing.

    The choice of guest beers looks to have improved with the new management, lets hope he can keep it up.

    A good selection of guest beers in a very comfortable pub.The pub had log fires in two rooms and we watched the football on the tele with a great pint of Golden Pippin.

    The first time we have been here since the new manager took over.The pub was pretty quiet but there was a good show of guest beers We went for the Bank Top Flat Cap and it is a very good pint.
