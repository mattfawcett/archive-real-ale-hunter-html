    I had a pint of Tetley&#x27;s Mild and am glad to say it was in pretty reasonable condition.



No guest beers were available.

    I tried the guest beer and the quality wasn&#x27;t great. It was drinkable but wasn&#x27;t very enjoyable. Its a shame really as this is a pretty nice pub. I get the feeling that not many people drink the guest beer here so thats probably why. The Tetleys and Black Sheep might be ok as more people will drink them.



I can&#x27;t remember what the guest beer was but I know that it has been the same one for quite a long time now.

    I had 2 pints of the guest beer Cheshire Gold and it was very nice. 



This was the second time that I have been to the Bridge Inn. The first time, a Titanic beer was the guest and it tasted disgusting, this time, the guest tasted fine but they did have to pull a couple of pints off before they gave us any so I am still undecided as to class it as a good real ale pub as I can&#x27;t guarantee the beer quality.
