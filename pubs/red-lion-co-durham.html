<meta name="description" content="Eighteenth century (1738), grade II listed, stone built Coaching Inn set in the idyllic Teesdale village of Cotherstone. 

Within the walls of the Red you won’t find a T.V, jukebox or bandit. Just the crackle of the open fire, good beer and the pulse of conversation and laughter. 

This old coaching inn has served the village and surrounding hamlets of Cotherstone with fine ales since its foundations were laid in 1738. The Red Lion can be described as a traditional, opened beamed, dales pub. There’s an open fire in the front bar and often a lively game of dominoes (5's & 3's) being played. The pub has a few claims to fame, aside from having Hannah Hauxswell as a neighbour and playing host to the final sketch of 'The Fast Show.' The pub also had the last heather thatched roof within the village and was only removed in the thirties.
