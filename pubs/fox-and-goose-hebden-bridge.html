<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Fox and Goose"/>
<meta name="description" content="This pub is amazing. They serve 5 hand pulled real ales and a cider which is the only draught beer served (they sell some bottled foreign beers) so no rubbish Fosters or Carling etc. The also is served without sparklers and lined glasses are used so you always get a full measure. 



On the bar on the far left you will usually find a session beer, then the regular Margerys Tiddlywink which is a very nice brew indeed. Next to that is the cider. On the next pump I there is usually a mild and on the 2 pumps on the right there will be a light and a dark strong ale.



There is a main bar area with an open fire and then a small room to the right where there is a Billiards table. To the left there is a large seating area. 



They have recently added a beer garden to the pub and host biannual beer festivals where they have up to 50 cask ales. They host regular live music, jam nights are every Wednesday, singaround folk club is 1st and 3rd night of every month.

    I tried each of the 4 guests and had a pint of the regular Marjorie&#x27;s. All very nice brews. There was some kind of jam night that started up in the evening.

    Well this has got to be one of the best pubs I have been in a long time. The beer quality is excellent and the range of guest beers was very good. If you are anywhere near this area it is worth venturing to find this.



Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get time to sample all the ales but of those I did especially the pubs own Margorys Tipple I was very impressed.
