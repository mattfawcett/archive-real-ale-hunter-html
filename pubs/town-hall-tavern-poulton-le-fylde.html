    The pub is having refurbishment and  only part was  open.They have a new bar which is in a different area and it looks if the drinking area will be larger than before.I will visit again when the work is finished.

    A good  today and the pub was very busy.nice selection of guest beers. We had the Bank Top beer which is getting very popular in the village and it was fine, but for me the J W LEES is my taste but not on the bar ofted enough.

    A good pub always a good choice of cask beers I had the dragon fire from Lees Brewery and as usual it as a top beer.My friends had Adnams and all liked it.This pub seems to be getting the most real ale trade in the village now.

    Last stop of the day at the Old Town Hall were normaly there is a reasonable choice of guest beers.We decided on the Pride of Pendle ,but it was not very good so we changed to Oakham which was slightly better. I surpose all pubs have a bad day.
