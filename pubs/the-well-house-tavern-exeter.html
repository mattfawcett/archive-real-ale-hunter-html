    </h4>
    I went into the Well House at lunch time on the 30th January 2012. 

On many previous visits to the pub at this time it has been both ram-packed and vibrant

On this occasion I was the only customer and remained so until I left 25min later.

No atmosphere, little character left and heavily outnumbered by bored staff I hastily finished my beer and departed.

The once excellent menu had been cut down to transport cafe proportions so I did not order food and the one ale, a favourite of mine, O&#x27;Hanlons Port Stout, that I tried was over temperature and tasted like the lines needed attention.

This was reported to the barmen who showed little visible interest.

I cannot now recommended the Well House 
and will not do so again until the management realise what a potential gem they have and restore it to the welcoming pub of the past.
