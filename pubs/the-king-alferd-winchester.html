Located in the very popular leafy residential area of Hyde, this charming, traditional Victorian English pub offers, Tourist Board awarded 4-star en suite guest accommodation in a great location â€“ ten minutes walk alongside the river (and the ducks!) into our famous City â€“ once the capital of England before London! Walking distance to Leisure Centre - 26m swimming pool, floodlit tennis courts, squash and group exercise classes.

Close to all of Winchesterâ€™s amenities and a short walk from the train station, bars, restaurants, shops, historical attractions, and city centre shopping. The King Alfred introduced its brand new, totally refurbished en-suite rooms in March 2008. 

King Alfred bedrooms feature all the modern comforts and facilities you need for a relaxing base - LCD flat-screen TVs, radio, with tea/coffee making facilities. Guests can also take advantage of the very popular restaurant, which offers a choice from the main menu, with chefâ€™s specials from the blackboard. The King Alfred boasts a truly charming garden, which is popular with locals and guests during the summer months for a jug of Pimms or one of the Guest Beers which are changed regularly - probably the best pub garden in Winchester! 

Our easy accessible location and high quality accommodation make the King Alfred a great base, whether you are exploring the region as a tourist or visiting the area on business. Winchester is ideally situated for those touring the south of England and the city is only a one-hour train journey from London.  Come and visit and see for yourself!"/>
