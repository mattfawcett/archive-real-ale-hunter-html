    Been way too long since I last visited this pub (hopefully will be going on Thursday....)



Last visit was a little surreal with the Barmaid putting up posters suggesting that the staff had lost their marbles. No she wasn&#x27;t saying they were all mad (that is just a given - no need to advertise!). They had lost a marble that they used to play miniature skittles.



Strangely some bloke happened to have found it in the toilets the previous day and had it in his pocket!



Can&#x27;t say which Ales were on tap this day as I truly can&#x27;t remember. Different every time I go in.
