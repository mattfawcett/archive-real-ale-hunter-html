<title>Holly House Hotel - Ravenglass | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Holly House Hotel"/>
<meta name="description" content="To the West of the Lake District, Holly House Hotel is located in Ravenglass, the national parks only coastal village, a 17th century small family run business offering an award winning bar, meals and rooms to customers and visitors alike.
There are five bedrooms which all have tea and coffee making facilities as well as colour TV. Hearty evening meals and breakfasts are served in the bar area.

There is a car park to the rear of the property allowing for off road parking for up to ten cars.

In front of the property is the Village Green where you are welcome to sit and enjoy a drink whilst watching the sun set over the estuary to three rivers; the Esk, the Mite and the Irt.

We are happy for you to bring children and pets as long as they are both kept under control.	
Regularly appearing in the Good Beer Guide, it was also awarded Pub of the Season, Spring 2009 (West Cumbria Branch) by CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ales).
