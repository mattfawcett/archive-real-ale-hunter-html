<meta name="description" content="We are located in the middle of St Annes Square, surrounded by a wide variety of shops. Fifteens has very unique dÃ©cor, there is no other bar around that is like us! Some would say it is tastefully decorated, others have described it as a 'Turkish junk shop'?! Whatever their views, it never fails to impress!!

Background easy listening music is played during the day which is then joined over time by the wonderful and weird selections made via the jukebox. This is used more in the evening and at weekends providing an eclectic mix of audio delight! The best jukebox makes the best pub!

Without being biased, we think Fifteens is the best pub in St Annes, with the best beer. We aren't not being bigheaded; it's what we get told. This has resulted in the pub being installed as the only pub in St Annes in the Good Beer Guide 2011.

Beer, Blackpool and Beer: this is what has made the pub it is today!

  We are located in the middle of St Annes Square, surrounded by a wide variety of shops. Fifteens has very unique dÃ©cor, there is no other bar around that is like us!
