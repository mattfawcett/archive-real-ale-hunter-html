    I tried both the guests and had a pint of Black Sheep Emmerdale. They have added 2 extra pumps (making 6 now) since I last visited but its a shame that 3 or 4 of them are always from Black Sheep

    it&#x27;s sold well, fruity aroma and taste.

    The real festival is on so there is an extra bar for real ale. long with the beers listed on the left, the bar also stocked:



Little Valley - Moor Ale

Little Valley - Tods Blonde

Elland - First Light

Elland - Best Bitter

Elland - Andomeda



and the floowing ciders:

Merrylegs, Countryman, Thatchers Cheddar Valley, West Croft Janets Jungle Juice, Wilkins Perry.



I tried a few of the ales and they tasted pretty decent but the only down side was that they were slightly too warm as the casks were behind the bar.



All the ales were Â£2.20 except for Black Mass and Gorlovka which were Â£2.30. The ciders were a bit more
