<title>Cock O&#x27; The North - Halifax | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Cock O&#x27; The North"/>
<meta name="description" content="With the ocassional guest ales on, a feature of Cock O' The North is that it brews each ale on sale. behind the bar! Yes, as you sit down you can see where everything is brewed through a glass door. Non Smoking environment, children and dog friendly. They brew and sell their own lager, (luftkissenfarhzueg) Their ales include unusual ingredients, nettles, rice, ginger and many more. 



with a beer garden they are open 5pm-1130pm week days and 12pm-1130pm sat and sun



This bar has been open nearly 1 year now although the owner has been brewing for many many years, providing pumps for many beer festivals far and wide



even though the owner has provided pumps and casks of ales for CAMRA free of charge in the past, CAMRA has refused to put this bar in the 'good beer guide' two years running now, there seems to be some hostility between CAMRA and this brewery. Cock O' The North has also been snubbed for any awards hosted and presented by CAMRA... Make your own mind up on this one. A superb place with great friendly staff. 



A unique feature of Cock O' The North is that all ales are served at below average temperature for a refreshing taste, and frozen glasses are in reserve for those who want that extra chill. 



They have a beer festival 24th May until 31st May. with 20 pumps on at once (usually 7) but this is nothing compared to the 40+ ales they have rotating during the month on the usual 7 pumps. This festival is to celebrate the bars first birthday!"/>
