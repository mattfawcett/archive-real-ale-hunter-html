     What can you say about the Lime Kilns??

The drinks were warm and when we complained the bar staff were very unpleasant stating that they only sell drinks warm?, when they did change them we were asked for an extra 80p.

The food was awful one order was fish which was over fried, another was lamb with gravy served with a salad ?? the gammon came with two fried eggs served like you would have had in a 1960 truckers cafÃ©. Any waste food is thrown on the canal side  to let the ducks eat it ? never seen ducks eating gammon before must be a new breed in this area.

The following day we both had to lose a day of work due to sickness and diarrhoea 

I would never recommend this pub to any one there is some real serious health and safety issues here.
