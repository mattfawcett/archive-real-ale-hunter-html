<title>The Commercial - Slaithwaite | Real Ale Hunter</title>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, The Commercial"/>
<meta name="description" content="This pub reopened in 2009 as a real ale house, and is a popular stop on the Real Ale trail being just down the hill from the station.

Of the nine hand pumps, two have the house beers from local brewer Empire (The lighter Commerciale which is brewed exclusively for the Commercial, and the darker Moonraker Mild) priced at Â£2.00 a pint, and a real cider from Westons, usually the excellent First Quality but occasionally a perry or a different Westons scrumpy is substituted.

The remaining six pumps are guest ales, frequently from local brewers such as Mallinsons, usually with a range of styles, so there should be something for everyone.  Draught Boddingtons creamflow is also available as is draught Guinness.  Lager drinkers are catered for with draught Becks and Staropramen and there's a range of bottled lagers and ciders, plus a reasonable wine list and coffee and tea.

Limited food and snacks are available at the weekends, with sandwiches, pork pies, cornish pasties from local suppliers.

The Commercial is definitely worth a visit."/>
