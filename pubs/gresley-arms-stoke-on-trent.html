<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="keywords" content="Real ale pubs, Gresley Arms"/>
<meta name="description" content="The Gresley Arms is Cask Ale Heaven serving 8 at any one time. A typical country pub set between 2 country parks in the idylic village of Alsagers Bank, Real Ale, Real Food and Real Fires who could ask for more? The Gresley Arms commands the Best Views in Staffordshire looking over 9 counties as well as the Welsh Mountains and Shropshire Hills.
The Gresley Arms has sat proudly at the top of Alsagers Bank for over 200 years with fantastic views from the Beer Garden and in the dining rooms. In the near distance Bateswood Country Park perfect for walking, bike or horse riding with a beautiful lake and nature reserve. Further afield to the left the Shropshire Hills including The Long Mynd and The Wrekin to the right is Runcorn Power Station and Liverpools two Cathedrals ( it is said on a clear day with good binoculars you can see Blackpool Tower ) look straight ahead beyond the castles of Beeston and Peckforton to The Berwyn Mountains,Exclusham Mountains Llangollen and beyond.Of course there's a lot in between and the resident telescope is a great help.
If walking is your thing The Gresley Arms sits between Bateswood and Apedale country parks Bateswood is fairly flat so ideal for a leisurely stroll, Apedale Country Park has more challenging signposted walks through the woods it also has a mining museum and visitors centre, we welcome walkers, dogs and children looking for refresments after a long walk. 
Our Philosophy is simple, we serve quality drinks specialising in Cask Ale at a fair price in a friendly atmosphere with a real fire in the winter and fantastic beer garden in the summer, food is available, again at a fair price including our famous 3 course Sunday Lunch for just Â£6.95 and our dining room has the best views in Staffordhire.
Our Pub has four individual rooms, a traditional Bar with slate floor and real fire, old pictures showing the history of the area adorn the walls. A comfortable lounge perfect for conversation and our newly refurbished bottom room home to a monthly folk night. The dining room feel a special place to eat with comfortable surroundings and fantastic views and coming soon our brand new 'Room with a View, a dining/function room with picture windows and a veranda.
